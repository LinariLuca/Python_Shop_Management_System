## 📌 Future work / possible improvements

1. Create a mechanism that, by means of a loyalty card, allows the most loyal customers to get a discount.
2. Create an internal game, in which if the customer (once a terminal timer is started) presses enter on a specific number, they win a prize (e.g. 30% discount).
3. Persist data to files or a SQLite database
4. Create a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt
